## Annotations
### Annotate
Use these tools to annotate your projects. Choose the tool depending on the shape of the object you want to annotate.
* Points
* Polyline
* Polygon
* Bounding box
* Ellipse
* Cuboid

:information_source: Use the ruler as a guide while annotating, and zoom in on the object for better annotation results.

:information_source: SuperAnnotate automatically saves your progress.
### Adjust annotation
Press **Esc** to delete the last point you added to your polygon and polyline.
### Delete annotation
**Method 1:** Select the annotation and press the backspace key or **Del** (Windows). 
**Method 2:** Find the annotation in the right panel and click on the corresponding **X** button.
To delete all the annotations from the image you’re working on, select **Revert** (trash icon) in the bottom panel or press **Ctrl+Shift+R** and confirm your action.

:information_source: Select :question: to get access to keyboard shortcuts. 
# Classes
## Create a class
**Method 1:**
1. Select **Add a class** in the right panel. 
2. Enter a name and choose a color.
3. Add an attribute group (optional).
To add an attribute group:
1. Select **New attribute group**.
2. Enter an attribute group name.
3. Enter an attribute and select **+**. You can add multiple attribute groups and attributes.
5. Check **Allow multiple selection** if the attributes can exist within an object simultaneously. When you do that, you’ll be able to assign multiple attributes to an object. For example, if your annotated object is a black and orange car, choose both black and orange from the attribute group. Do not check **Allow multiple selection** if the attributes can’t exist simultaneously. For example, a dog can’t be small and medium at the same time. 
**Method 2:**
1. Right-click on the instance.
2. Open the drop-down menu and select **Create new class**.
3. Enter a name and choose a color.
## Assign class
Use one of these methods to assign a class to an instance:

**Method 1:** Right-click on an instance and choose a class from the drop-down menu.

**Method 2:** Select an instance, find it in the right panel, and choose a class from the drop-down menu.

**Method 3:** Select the **Eyedropper** tool, click on an object to sample its class. The **Eyedropper** tool will change into the **Bucket** tool. Next, select your unassigned object(s). The **Eyedropper** tool facilitates the class assignment of multiple objects.

Alternatively, you can assign a class to your object before annotating it. Follow these steps: 
1. Select the class selection tool in the left panel.
2. Choose a class. 
3. Annotate your object using any tool you want. 

Your instance will be immediately assigned to the class you’ve chosen.
## Change class
You can change a class in two ways:
**Method 1:** Right-click on your object and choose a class from the drop-down menu.
**Method 2:** Select your object, find it in the right panel, select the ellipsis button, and move your object to a different existing class.
# Objects
## Copy objects
You can copy instances as well as their assigned classes and attributes in one image or to other images:
1. Select the instance, and click **Copy** in the top panel, or press **Ctrl+C**.
2. Click **Paste** in the top panel or press **Ctrl+V**.
## Group objects
In some cases, you might need to use more than one tool to annotate a single object. To let the system know that several instances belong together, you need to group them. 
1. Select an instance, and press and hold the **Ctrl** key.
2. While holding the Ctrl key, click on the instances you want to select.
3. Select **Group** in the top panel.
If you think you’ve made a mistake, select **Ungroup** or press **Ctrl+Shift+G** and start over.
## Show/Hide objects
Select the eye button in the top panel or press **R** to show or hide the instances.
# Images
## Upload images
To upload an image, select **Upload** in the bottom panel, and choose **Image**. Next, select images from your computer and click **Open**.
## Delete images
To delete an image, hover over the information icon in the image panel and select the trash icon.
## Set image status
An image can have one of the following statuses:
* Not started
* In progress
* Complete

To set an image as **Complete**, select **Complete** at the bottom of the right panel. Note that you should classify all the instances to be able to set an image as **Complete**.

To see the status of an image, go to the image panel and hover over the icon on the right. 
## Add tags
1. Select **Tags** in the left panel.
2. Enter a tag in the text box.
3. Click the **+** button.
4. Select **Save**.
## Adjust settings
Adjust the settings of your image by dragging the slider to the left or to the right:
* Brightness
* Fill (instance transparency)
* Contrast
## Show labels
Select **Show/Hide labels** in the top panel to see the following labels on your image:
* Classes
* Attributes
* Points 
* Groups
You can also expand an instance in the right panel to see its attributes and point labels.
